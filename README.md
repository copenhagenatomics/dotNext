Quick overview of additional features:

* [Attachment of user data to an arbitrary objects](https://dotnet.github.io/dotNext/features/core/userdata.html)
* Extended set of [atomic operations](https://dotnet.github.io/dotNext/features/core/atomic.html). Inspired by [AtomicInteger](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicInteger.html) and friends from Java
* [Fast Reflection](https://dotnet.github.io/dotNext/features/reflection/fast.html)
* Fast conversion of bytes to hexadecimal representation and vice versa using `ToHex` and `FromHex` methods from [Span](https://dotnet.github.io/dotNext/api/DotNext.Span.html) static class
* `ManualResetEvent`, `ReaderWriterLockSlim` and other synchronization primitives now have their [asynchronous versions](https://dotnet.github.io/dotNext/features/threading/rwlock.html)
* [Atomic](https://dotnet.github.io/dotNext/features/core/atomic.html) memory access operations for arbitrary value types including enums
* [PipeExtensions](https://dotnet.github.io/dotNext/api/DotNext.IO.Pipelines.PipeExtensions.html) provides high-level I/O operations for pipelines such as string encoding and decoding
* A rich set of high-performance [memory buffers](https://dotnet.github.io/dotNext/features/io/buffers.html) for efficient I/O
* String formatting, encoding and decoding with low GC pressure: [dynamic char buffers](https://dotnet.github.io/dotNext/features/io/buffers.html#char-buffer)
* Fully-featured [Raft implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotNext/tree/master/src/cluster)
* Fully-featured [HyParView implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/dotNext/tree/master/src/cluster)

All these things are implemented in 100% managed code on top of existing .NET API without modifications of Roslyn compiler or CoreFX libraries.

# What's new
Release Date: 11-15-2021

.NEXT 4.0 Release Candidate is out! Its primary focus is .NET 6 support as well as some other key features:
* Native support of [C# 10 Interpolated Strings](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/string-interpolation-in-c-10-and-net-6/) across various buffer types, streams and other I/O enhancements. String building and string encoding/decoding with zero allocation overhead is now a reality
* All asynchronous locks do not allocate [tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task) anymore in case of lock contention. Instead, they are moved to [ValueTask](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.valuetask) pooling
* `ValueTaskCompletionSource` and `ValueTaskCompletionSource<T>` classes are stabilized and used as a core of [ValueTask](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.valuetask) pooling
* Introduced Raft-native cluster membership management as proposed in Diego's original paper instead of external discovery mechanism
* Introduced Gossip-based messaging framework

Use [this](https://dotnet.github.io/dotNext/migration/index.html) guide to migrate from 3.x.

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnext/4.0.0">DotNext 4.0.0</a>
* Added `DotNext.Span.Shuffle` and `DotNext.Collections.Generic.List.Shuffle` extension methods that allow to randomize position of elements within span/collection
* Added `DotNext.Collections.Generic.Sequence.Copy` extension method for making copy of the original enumerable collection. The memory for the copy is always rented from the pool
* Added `DotNext.Collections.Generic.Collection.PeekRandom` extension method that allows to select random element from the collection
* Improved performance of `DotNext.Span.TrimLength` and `StringExtensions.TrimLength` extension methods
* Introduced `DotNext.Buffers.BufferHelpers.TrimLength` extension methods for [ReadOnlyMemory&lt;T&gt;](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.readonlymemory-1) and [Memory&lt;T&gt;](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.memory-1) data types
* Improved performance of `DotNext.Buffers.BufferWriter<T>.AddAll` method
* Reduced memory allocations by `ElementAt`, `FirstOrEmpty`, `FirstOrNull`, `ForEach` extension methods in `DotNext.Collections.Generic.Sequence` class
* Added `DotNext.Numerics.BitVector` that allows to convert **bool** vectors into integral types
* Added ability to write interpolated strings to `IBufferWriter<char>` without temporary allocations
* Added ability to write interpolated strings to `BufferWriterSlim<char>`. This makes `BufferWriterSlim<char>` type as allocation-free alternative to [StringBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.stringbuilder)
* Introduced a concept of binary-formattable types. See `DotNext.Buffers.IBinaryFormattable<TSelf>` interface for more information
* Introduced `Reference<T>` type as a way to pass the reference to the memory location in asynchronous scenarios
* `Box<T>` is replaced with `Reference<T>` value type
* `ITypeMap<T>` interface and implementing classes allow to associate an arbitrary value with the type
* Added overloaded `Result<T, TError>` value type for C-style error handling

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnext.metaprogramming/4.0.0">DotNext.Metaprogramming 4.0.0</a>
* Added support of interpolated string expression as described in [this article](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/string-interpolation-in-c-10-and-net-6/) using `InterpolationExpression.Create` static method
* Added support of task pooling to async lambda expressions
* Migration to C# 10 and .NET 6

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnext.reflection/4.0.0">DotNext.Reflection 4.0.0</a>
* Migration to C# 10 and .NET 6

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnext.unsafe/4.0.0">DotNext.Unsafe 4.0.0</a>
* Unmanaged memory pool has moved to [NativeMemory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.nativememory) class instead of [Marshal.AllocHGlobal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshal.allochglobal) method

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnext.threading/4.0.0">DotNext.Threading 4.0.0</a>
* Polished `ValueTaskCompletionSource` and `ValueTaskCompletionSource<T>` data types. Also these types become a foundation for all synchronization primitives within the library
* Return types of all methods of asynchronous locks now moved to [ValueTask](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.valuetask) and [ValueTask&lt;T&gt;](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.valuetask-1) types
* Together with previous change, all asynchronous locks are written on top of `ValueTaskCompletionSource` and `ValueTaskCompletionSource<T>` data types. It means that these asynchronous locks use task pooling that leads to zero allocation on the heap and low GC latency
* Added `AsyncEventHub` synchronization primitve for asynchronous code
* Introduced diagnostics and debugging tools for all synchronization primitives: lock contentions, information about suspended callers, et. al.

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnext.io/4.0.0">DotNext.IO 4.0.0</a>
* Added `DotNext.IO.SequenceBinaryReader.Position` property that allows to obtain the current position of the reader in the underlying sequence
* Added `DotNext.IO.SequenceBinaryReader.Read(Span<byte>)` method
* Optimized performance of some `ReadXXX` methods of `DotNext.IO.SequenceReader` type
* All `WriteXXXAsync` methods of `IAsyncBinaryWriter` are replaced with a single `WriteFormattableAsync` method supporting [ISpanFormattable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.ispanformattable) interface. Now you can encode efficiently any type that implements this interface
* Added `FileWriter` and `FileReader` classes that are tuned for fast file I/O with the ability to access the buffer explicitly
* Introduced a concept of a serializable Data Transfer Objects represented by `ISerializable<TSelf>` interface. The interface allows to control the serialization/deserialization behavior on top of `IAsyncBinaryWriter` and `IAsyncBinaryReader` interfaces. Thanks to static abstract interface methods, the value of the type can be easily reconstructed from its serialized state
* Added support of binary-formattable types to `IAsyncBinaryWriter` and `IAsyncBinaryReader` interfaces
* Improved performance of `FileBufferingWriter` I/O operations with preallocated file size feature introduced in .NET 6
* `StreamExtensions.Combine` allows to represent multiple streams as a single stream

* Optimized memory allocation for each hearbeat message emitted by Raft node in leader state
* Fixed compatibility of WAL Interpreter Framework with TCP/UDP transports
* Added support of Raft-native cluster configuration management that allows to use Raft features for managing cluster members instead of external discovery protocol
* Persistent WAL has moved to new implementation of asynchronous locks to reduce the memory allocation
* Added various snapshot building strategies: incremental and inline
* Optimized file I/O performance of persistent WAL
* Reduced the number of opened file descriptors required by persistent WAL
* Improved performance of partitions allocation in persistent WAL with preallocated file size feature introduced in .NET 6
* Fixed packet loss for TCP/UDP transports
* Added read barrier for linearizable reads on Raft follower nodes

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnext.aspnetcore.cluster/4.0.0">DotNext.AspNetCore.Cluster 4.0.0</a>
* Added configurable HTTP protocol version selection policy
* Added support of leader lease in Raft implementation for optimized read operations
* Added `IRaftCluster.LeadershipToken` property that allows to track leadership transfer
* Introduced `IRaftCluster.Readiness` property that represents the readiness probe. The probe indicates whether the cluster member is ready to serve client requests
